			<h1>About SPESSE</h1>
			<h3>Sustainable Procurement Environmental and Social Standards Enhancement</h3>
			<p>The Sustainable Procurement, Environmental and Social Standards Enhancement (SPESSE) Program is an $80 Million capacity building project targeted at sustainably enhancing capacity in managing procurement, environment and social (E&S) standards in the public and private sectors in Nigeria. This project is critical to the Government of Nigeria as it contributes directly to the current administrationâ€™s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), which is aimed at accelerating structural reforms to alleviate increasing poverty and inequality by: bringing consistency to the monetary and fiscal policy, spurting job-creation through policies consistent with private sector development, and creating sustainable fiscal space for desperately needed investments in human and physical capitals and importantly, reduce the cost of governance.
